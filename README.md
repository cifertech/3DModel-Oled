# 3DModel-Oled
Controlling a 3D Model Using a change of x, y values obtained from the gyro module, the status of the model changes.

## What it DO!
We will control a cube, we will design the cube in the project code, so that we will define different angles in the code and in the program conditions we will specify the appearance changes of the cube in exchange for changing the values of x, y. Finally, we print the cube shape on the OLED display and change the angle of the MPU module to see the change in the angles of the cube.

### Items needed
-ESP8266
-Oled
-MPU6050

### Required libraries
-Adafruit_SSD1306
-Adafruit_GFX
-Wire
-SPI

## Conclusion
Using this widely used module as well as the OLED display, control a 3D model. Using the x, y values obtained from the gyro module, the status of the model changes. In other words, the 3D displacement of the gyro sensor is visually displayed on the OLED display.
